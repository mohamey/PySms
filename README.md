# PySms
A simple open source solution to sending mass Texts through your desktop. To get started, simply download the project and run Pysms.py using a python interpreter. This is a cross platform solution that should work on Windows, OSX and Linux Distributions. Official builds of the application will be released soon on http://mohamey.me, after support for more networks has been added.
